# GitHub Actions Migration to Railway

## ✅ **Migration Complete**

The system has been successfully migrated from GitHub Actions to Railway with built-in WebSocket server.

### **What Changed:**

1. **Railway Continuous Scraper** (`src/scrapers/continuous_scraper.py`)
   - Runs every 5 seconds with built-in WebSocket server
   - Uses existing Python scraper with WebSocket publishing
   - Preserves all smart caching and delta logic

2. **Built-in WebSocket Server** (`RailwayWebSocketServer`)
   - No external dependencies (replaces Pusher)
   - Real-time updates to all connected clients
   - Maintains delta updates (new/removed incidents)
   - Preserves center-specific channels

3. **Enhanced Frontend** (`js/data-manager.js`, `js/app-realtime.js`)
   - Real-time WebSocket updates
   - Smart caching with WebSocket integration
   - Delta update handling

### **To Disable GitHub Actions:**

1. **Option A: Disable the workflow file**
   ```bash
   mv .github/workflows/traffic-scraper.yml .github/workflows/traffic-scraper.yml.disabled
   ```

2. **Option B: Remove the cron schedule**
   - Edit `.github/workflows/traffic-scraper.yml`
   - Comment out or remove the `schedule` section

3. **Option C: Keep for manual triggers only**
   - Remove the `schedule` section
   - Keep `workflow_dispatch` for manual runs

### **Environment Variables Needed:**

Add these to Railway environment variables:
- `GMAIL_SENDER_EMAIL` (for email notifications)
- `GMAIL_RECIPIENT_EMAIL` (for email notifications)
- `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` (for email notifications)
- `ENABLE_EMAIL_NOTIFICATIONS` (set to true to enable)

### **Benefits:**

- ✅ **12x faster updates** (5s vs 60s)
- ✅ **Real-time WebSocket updates** (no external dependencies)
- ✅ **Preserved smart caching**
- ✅ **Preserved delta logic**
- ✅ **Cost effective** ($5-15/month vs $35-40/month)
- ✅ **Automatic scaling**

### **Next Steps:**

1. Deploy to Railway
2. Set environment variables
3. Test continuous scraper execution
4. Disable GitHub Actions
5. Monitor WebSocket connections
